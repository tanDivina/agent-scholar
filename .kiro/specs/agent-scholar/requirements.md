# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Agent Scholar is an autonomous AI research and analysis agent designed for researchers, analysts, and students. Unlike traditional document search systems, Agent Scholar actively interacts with knowledge bases, external tools, and code execution environments to synthesize novel insights from curated libraries. The system transforms static document collections into interactive research environments that can validate claims, cross-reference sources, execute analytical code, and provide comprehensive multi-source analysis.

The agent is built on AWS services including Amazon Bedrock Agent, OpenSearch Serverless, and Lambda functions to create a scalable, serverless architecture that demonstrates advanced AI agent capabilities for the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core AI Agent Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want an intelligent agent that can understand complex multi-step research queries and autonomously decide which tools and knowledge sources to use, so that I can get comprehensive answers without manually coordinating different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a research query THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock Agent as the core reasoning engine
2. WHEN the agent receives a query THEN it SHALL decompose complex requests into actionable sub-tasks
3. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL use a high-performance LLM from Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet or Llama 3)
4. WHEN the agent needs to use tools THEN it SHALL autonomously select and orchestrate the appropriate action groups
5. IF a query requires multiple steps THEN the agent SHALL maintain context across tool invocations

### Requirement 2: Semantic Knowledge Base Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to have deep semantic understanding of my document library, so that it can find relevant information based on concepts and meaning rather than just keyword matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL convert them to vector embeddings using Amazon Titan Text Embeddings
2. WHEN embeddings are created THEN they SHALL be stored in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless with vector indexing
3. WHEN the agent searches the knowledge base THEN it SHALL perform semantic similarity searches
4. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL integrate results directly into the Bedrock Agent's reasoning process
5. IF multiple documents contain related information THEN the agent SHALL identify and synthesize connections

### Requirement 3: Web Search Integration Tool

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to access current information from the web to complement my library, so that I can get the most up-to-date perspective on any topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent determines current information is needed THEN it SHALL invoke the web search action group
2. WHEN web search is triggered THEN a Lambda function SHALL query external search APIs (SERP API or Google Search API)
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the agent SHALL cross-reference findings with the core library
4. WHEN web information conflicts with library content THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies
5. IF recent developments are found THEN the agent SHALL integrate them into the comprehensive response

### Requirement 4: Code Execution Capabilities

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to execute Python code to validate theories, generate visualizations, and perform calculations mentioned in documents, so that I can see practical demonstrations of concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query requires computational analysis THEN the agent SHALL invoke the code execution action group
2. WHEN code execution is needed THEN a Lambda function SHALL provide a sandboxed Python environment
3. WHEN executing code THEN the system SHALL handle data visualization, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling
4. WHEN code generates outputs THEN results SHALL be integrated into the agent's response with explanations
5. IF code execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and alternative approaches

### Requirement 5: Cross-Library Analysis Tool

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to identify thematic connections, contradictions, and author perspectives across multiple documents in my library, so that I can understand different viewpoints and build comprehensive knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asked to compare sources THEN the agent SHALL invoke the cross-library analysis action group
2. WHEN analyzing multiple documents THEN a Lambda function SHALL identify thematic connections and contradictions
3. WHEN contradictions are found THEN the system SHALL present different perspectives with source attribution
4. WHEN themes are identified THEN the agent SHALL provide author-to-author comparisons
5. IF synthesis opportunities exist THEN the system SHALL suggest novel insights from combined sources

### Requirement 6: Scalable Serverless Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the entire infrastructure to be serverless and reproducible, so that the system can scale automatically and be easily deployed by others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use only serverless AWS components (API Gateway, Lambda, Bedrock, OpenSearch Serverless)
2. WHEN infrastructure is defined THEN it SHALL be completely specified using AWS CDK
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL handle increased load automatically without manual intervention
4. WHEN deployment is requested THEN the entire stack SHALL be reproducible with a single CDK command
5. IF judges want to review THEN they SHALL be able to redeploy the complete system independently

### Requirement 7: Interactive Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive chat interface where I can ask complex research questions and see the agent's reasoning process, so that I can understand how conclusions are reached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL interact through a web-based chat interface (Streamlit or Gradio)
2. WHEN the agent processes queries THEN it SHALL display its reasoning and tool selection process
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN they SHALL include source citations and methodology explanations
4. WHEN multiple tools are used THEN the interface SHALL show the sequence of actions taken
5. IF visualizations are created THEN they SHALL be displayed inline with explanations

### Requirement 8: Complex Multi-Step Query Processing

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to ask sophisticated questions that require multiple research steps, tool usage, and synthesis, so that I can get comprehensive analysis in a single interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving complex queries THEN the system SHALL handle multi-step research workflows
2. WHEN processing involves multiple tools THEN the agent SHALL coordinate their usage in logical sequence
3. WHEN synthesis is required THEN the system SHALL combine results from knowledge base, web search, and code execution
4. WHEN final responses are generated THEN they SHALL be comprehensive with supporting evidence and analysis
5. IF clarification is needed THEN the agent SHALL ask targeted follow-up questions

### Requirement 9: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and reliably even with complex queries, so that my research workflow is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simple queries are submitted THEN responses SHALL be generated within 10 seconds
2. WHEN complex multi-tool queries are processed THEN responses SHALL be completed within 60 seconds
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN meaningful error messages SHALL be provided with recovery suggestions
4. WHEN high load occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through auto-scaling
5. IF any component fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than complete failure

### Requirement 10: Security and Data Privacy

**User Story:** As a researcher with sensitive documents, I want my data to be secure and private, so that I can trust the system with confidential research materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN they SHALL be encrypted in transit and at rest
2. WHEN user sessions are active THEN access SHALL be properly authenticated and authorized
3. WHEN external APIs are called THEN sensitive information SHALL not be exposed
4. WHEN code is executed THEN it SHALL run in isolated, secure environments
5. IF data breaches are attempted THEN the system SHALL have appropriate security monitoring and response
